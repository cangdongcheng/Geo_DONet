# Geo_DONet on Vanda — handoff

> **2026-09-19 — local project rename.** The root directory is now
> `/home/svu/e1032484/Geo_DONet` (equivalent `/nfs/home/svu/e1032484/Geo_DONet`).
> `DIMON_learn` remains a symlink for existing checkpoint paths and IDE sessions.
> Active scripts/PBS files use the new root. The original benchmark is therefore
> at `Geo_DONet/Geo_DONet/`; experiment subfolders were not renamed. Historical
> output logs and binary artifacts retain their original paths. Git history and
> existing uncommitted changes were preserved. GitHub rename is pending
> authenticated repository-admin access; origin still points to the old name.

Temporary working copy while NSCC is down (started 2026-05-29).
Native home is NSCC `BASE/cardiac_simulation/DIMON/` (user `e1590340`).
Active variants: **Geo_DONet** (clean rewrite), **Geo_DONet_SIREN**, **Geo_DONet_ndiff**,
**Geo_DONet_overfit** (single-case capacity test), **Geo_DeepONet_PCA**, and **Geo_MLP**.

> **2026-08-12 — phase-aligned decoder + architecture-ablation update.** Later work moved from
> changing the Geo_DONet trunk toward separating activation time from waveform shape. The f601
> phase-aligned oracle is extremely accurate, and training AT + five PCA features through the
> differentiable V_m decoder substantially improves global V_m/AT metrics. It still produces a
> very smooth upstroke. A conditional MLP looked better on one fixed split but lost that advantage
> under five-fold CV. See **August 2026 progress** below; it supersedes older open-item language
> where the corresponding experiment is now complete.

> **2026-06-03 — Geo_DONet is now a clean rewrite.** The original messy `Geo_DONet/` was
> deleted and replaced by the from-scratch clean version (formerly `Geo_DONet_clean/`). It is a
> 4-file package: `main.py` (CONFIGURATION + CLI + train/infer), `opnn.py` (architecture +
> checkpoint loaders), `utils.py` (data + evaluation, numpy/torch only), `viz.py` (rendering/IO).
> Modes: train (default) / `--test-model` / `--infer`. Weights-only checkpoints; can still load
> the OLD opnn checkpoints (legacy-key remap). See **Code edits → Geo_DONet/**.

> **2026-06-04 — Geo_DONet_SIREN is now a clean rewrite too** (same 4-file structure as
> Geo_DONet). The 777-line monolithic `main.py` + old `opnn.py` are archived under
> `Geo_DONet_SIREN/_old_monolithic/`; the new package is `main.py`/`opnn.py` + **self-contained
> copies** of Geo_DONet's `utils.py`/`viz.py` (user chose copy over import-coupling). Kept the
> **ndiff loss**, **dropped** the `--trunk xyz` option (Cobiveco-only now, like the baseline),
> dropped the legacy learnable bias. SIREN checkpoints store `{model_state_dict, config}` (config
> carries `omega_0`, which is NOT inferable from weights) — and the loader still reads the OLD
> original-opnn SIREN checkpoints (legacy-key remap, omega_0 assumed 30). `Geo_DONet_ndiff/`
> remains an old-opnn variant. See **Code edits → Geo_DONet_SIREN/**.

> **2026-06-03 — single-case overfit capacity test (`Geo_DONet_overfit/`).** To separate
> *capacity* from *generalization* in the upshoot-smearing problem (prior runs all blamed the
> trunk's spatial representation — see Findings), a new folder overfits the **baseline arch
> (w300 d4 Tanh)** on one heart (case 0). With one geometry the branch collapses to a constant
> vector, so this is a clean test of the trunk coordinate-MLP: can it represent the sharp
> depolarization upstroke *at all*? Run at f121/f301/f601 to separate the Tanh trunk's limit
> from the 5 ms grid's temporal undersampling (the upstroke rises in ~1–2 ms, so at f121's 5 ms
> dt it spans < 1 frame). See **Code edits → Geo_DONet_overfit/**.

> 2026-05-29 (later session): added a ground-truth/prediction **neighbour-difference

> Vm node order, `reference.vtu` is NOT — is in the **Mesh node order** section below.
> Read it before any edge/adjacency/gradient work.

## August 2026 progress

### Phase-aligned PCA oracle

Scripts: `scratch_scripts/phase_aligned_pca_analysis.py` and `phase_aligned_pca.pbs`.
The decoder aligns every node waveform by its -10 mV activation time, subtracts a node-specific
lookup template, and applies PCA to the remaining waveform residual. Basis:
`~/scratch/pca_phase_aligned_basis_f601.npz`.

On the held-out 25 hearts at f601:

| decoder | aligned cum. EVR | V_m Rel L2 | V_m MAE | upstroke fraction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| K=1 | 0.6185 | 0.0152 | 0.094 mV | 0.817 |
| K=5 | 0.9706 | 0.0139 | 0.080 mV | 0.822 |
| K=10 | 0.9976 | 0.0138 | 0.067 mV | 0.822 |
| shift round-trip floor | — | 0.0138 | 0.058 mV | 0.822 |

Thus five modes are a reasonable compact decoder; its oracle error is negligible compared with
the learned surrogate. The nonzero floor comes mainly from shifting/interpolation, not PCA.

### Geo_DeepONet_PCA waveform-loss run

Folder: `Geo_DeepONet_PCA/`. Compact features:
`~/scratch/geo_deeponet_pca_f601_k5.npz`. The network predicts
`[AT, PC1, ..., PC5]`, decodes all 601 time values differentiably, and minimizes normalized V_m
MSE. The run used width 200, depth 4, Adam 5e-4, batch 8 hearts, 2,048 random nodes/step, fixed
4,096-node validation, and `feature_loss_weight=0`; `ATdiag` and `PCAdiag` are logs only.

Checkpoint: `Geo_DeepONet_PCA/CheckPts/geodeeponet_pca_vmloss_k5_w200_d4_n2048_5000ep.pt`.
Fixed-split test result:

| metric | mean +/- std |
|---|---:|
| decoded V_m Rel L2 | 0.13385 +/- 0.01898 |
| decoded V_m MAE | **1.887 +/- 0.380 mV** |
| direct predicted AT MAE | **4.504 +/- 1.066 ms** |
| AT re-extracted from decoded V_m | 4.533 +/- 1.045 ms |
| decoded max-dV/dt fraction | **0.330 +/- 0.006** |

The V_m and AT metrics are much better than the f121 Geo_DONet fixed-split benchmark
(4.73 mV / about 6.03 ms), but the upstroke fraction is much worse than the oracle's 0.822.
Large individual PCA-coordinate errors are not contradictory: with no direct feature loss, AT
and coefficients can trade off under the decoder, so the feature representation is not uniquely
identified. Judge this run primarily by decoded V_m, AT, and dV/dt.

The matched old `Geo_DeepONet/` AT-only run (width 200, depth 4, 5,000 epochs) gives
AT Rel L2 **0.1116 +/- 0.0203** and MAE **7.28 +/- 1.80 ms**. Both it and the PCA run use Adam
at **5e-4**, but this is not a controlled loss-only ablation: the old default batch of 96 covers
all 95 training hearts in one optimizer update/epoch, while the PCA run uses about 12 updates/
epoch, spatial sampling, a six-output learned head, and waveform-space checkpoint selection.
Also note that `Geo_DeepONet` default checkpoint/output names omit width, depth, and batch size;
pass an explicit `--ckpt-path` to avoid silently overwriting runs.

### Blur diagnostics

Scripts: `scratch_scripts/temporal_blur_diagnostic.py` and
`scratch_scripts/spatial_blur_diagnostic.py`. Both compare smoothed ground truth against the same
clean Geo_DONet prediction; smoothing is applied to GT only.

- Temporal, all 25 test hearts: baseline 4.728 mV. Sigma 7.5 ms gives the best MAE
  (4.191 mV, **11.35% improvement**); sigma 10 ms is best by MSE.
- Spatial, first test heart only: baseline 5.197 mV. Repeated neighbour relaxation with alpha
  0.5 is best by MAE at 16 passes (4.214 mV, **18.92% improvement**); 32 passes is best by MSE.
- The different 4.728 and 5.197 baselines are expected: the temporal table aggregates all 25
  hearts, while the recorded spatial table is one heart. A 25-heart spatial mode was added for a
  like-for-like aggregate comparison, but no completed batch summary is currently recorded here.
- `total absolute error` in these summaries is a raw sum over every included case/node/time
  sample, not an average; use MAE for comparisons across differently sized runs.

The diagnostics support both spatial and temporal smoothing, but because even strong blur closes
only part of the error, they do not prove that blur is the only failure mode.

### Conditional MLP ablation

`Geo_MLP/` takes `[60 geometry PCA, 4 Cobiveco, normalized time]` and directly predicts V_m with
one Tanh MLP. It is a pointwise conditional MLP, not a literal 60-to-(nodes x times) dense output.

| protocol | V_m Rel L2 | V_m MAE | interpolated AT MAE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| fixed 95/5/25 split | 0.1719 +/- 0.0311 | **3.82 +/- 0.94 mV** | 6.33 +/- 1.84 ms |
| five-fold pooled, all 125 hearts | 0.2080 +/- 0.0926 | **5.09 +/- 3.70 mV** | 8.41 +/- 5.45 ms |
| Geo_DONet five-fold reference | 0.1534 +/- 0.0235 | **4.64 +/- 1.61 mV** | 6.03 +/- 1.23 ms |

The MLP beat Geo_DONet on the original fixed split, but not in pooled five-fold CV. Its much larger
fold/case variance means the fixed split was optimistic. Do not claim a general architectural
advantage from the single-split result.

## Environment

```bash
source ~/load_dimon_env.sh
```

Loader script lives at `~/load_dimon_env.sh`. It loads `Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0` (only for `libpython3.11.so`) and activates `~/venvs/dimon`, which has:

| package | version | source |
|---|---|---|
| python | 3.11.3 | EB module |
| torch | 2.1.2+cu121 | pip wheel from download.pytorch.org |
| numpy | 1.26.4 | pip |
| scipy | 1.11.4 | pip |
| scikit-learn | 1.3.2 | pip |
| matplotlib | 3.7.5 | pip |
| meshio | 5.3.5 | pip (reads canonical.vtu; writes .vtu/.pvd outputs) |
| h5py | 3.16.0 | pip (compact XDMF time series; optional) |

**Important:** do NOT use Vanda's EasyBuild module `PyTorch/2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1`. It was built for `sm_70` only and fails on the A40 (sm_86) with `no kernel image is available for execution on the device`. The pip wheel ships kernels for sm_50–sm_90, which is why the venv uses it instead.

## Data

Currently in `~/scratch/`:

| file | size | shape summary |
|---|---|---|
| `geo_donet_data_f121.npz` | 2.3 GB | 125 hearts × 50797 nodes × 121 frames (5 ms step) |
| `geo_donet_data_f601.npz` | 11 GB  | same, 601 frames (1 ms step) — derive f301 on the fly via `--frame-step 2` |

Keys: `theta (125,60)`, `coords (50797,4)` Cobiveco, `vm (125,50797,T)`, `ecg (125,T,10)`, `time (T,)`, `case_names (125,)`.

Reference mesh / geometry (uploaded 2026-05-29, in `~/scratch/`):

| file | size | what |
|---|---|---|
| `canonical.vtu` | 18 MB | reference tet mesh **in Vm node order** (50797 pts, 254337 tets). Carries `ab/rt/tm/tv/rvlv`, `fiber`, `sheet`, `scar`, `healthy_sim_0..8`, `scar_sim_0..8`. |
| `reference_cobiveco.npz` | 756 KB | `cobiveco (50797,5)` = `canonical.vtu` point_data in order (`labels=[ab,rt,tm,tv,rvlv]`); first 4 cols == `geo_donet` `coords` exactly. |
| `reference.vtu` | 6.6 MB | same mesh, **DIFFERENT node order** — do NOT use for adjacency (see Mesh node order). |
| `reference/mesh_adjacency_data_order.npz` | 2.4 MB | derived: `edge_src/edge_dst` (320286 undirected), `inv_length`, `points_xyz`, `n_nodes`, all in Vm order. Built by `scratch_scripts/build_adjacency_canonical.py`. |

**3D-snapshot cartesian coords without DIMON_training_data_healthy.npz:**
`~/scratch/canonical.vtu` (50797 pts) → `scratch_scripts/extract_canonical_xyz.py` writes `~/scratch/canonical_xyz.npz` (key `cartesian_coords`, 50797×3). The extractor verifies the VTU's ab/rt/tm/tv match the training-npz Cobiveco row-for-row (got exact 0.0 diff → identical node order). `Geo_DONet_SIREN/main.py` has a `load_cartesian_coords()` helper that prefers `DIMON_training_data_healthy.npz` and falls back to `canonical_xyz.npz` (override path via `DIMON_CARTESIAN_NPZ`). This unblocks 3D V_m snapshot + AT-scatter rendering on Vanda. The clean **Geo_DONet/** now uses `canonical_xyz.npz` directly (`--snapshot --reference-xyz`, which defaults to it). `Geo_DONet_ndiff/` still only has the `--skip-snapshots` guard (old opnn).

**Not yet on Vanda** — only needed for the listed cases:

| file | needed by |
|---|---|
| `DIMON_training_data_healthy.npz` | all Cobiveco/* and DIMON_PINN variants (clean Geo_DONet uses `canonical_xyz.npz` instead; it is Cobiveco-only) |
| `DIMON_training_data_healthy_fixed.npz` | DIMON_PINN; Cobiveco/ |
| `Laplace_data{,_supp,_supp2000}.mat` | upstream Laplace example |
| RD / LV example data | upstream ReactionDiffusion, LV |

## Mesh node order — READ BEFORE ANY EDGE/ADJACENCY/GRADIENT WORK

The training data (`geo_donet_data_*.npz` `vm`/`coords`) is in **`canonical.vtu` node
order**, verified exactly (0.0 diff): `canonical.vtu` point_data `ab/rt/tm/tv/rvlv` (f32)
== `reference_cobiveco.npz` == `geo_donet` `coords`. Chain: the cobiveco-extract script
read `canonical.vtu` point_data in order → `reference_cobiveco.npz`; packaging copied that
into `coords` and stacked `vm` in the same order.

`reference.vtu` is the **same mesh in a different node numbering** (in-order max|diff| ≈
0.98). Coordinate-matching it to the data is fuzzy at the apex (rt collapses there) — so
build adjacency from **`canonical.vtu` only**. The adjacency (320286 undirected edges, mean
length 1497.6 µm — matches the ~1500 µm mesh and the old `edge_grad_operator.npz` edge count)
is saved at `~/scratch/reference/mesh_adjacency_data_order.npz`.

**Hypothesis:** `Geo_DONet_grad`'s gradient loss may have "failed" only because its
`edge_grad_operator.npz` was built in a non-Vm order → every `G·vm` differenced
non-adjacent nodes. `Geo_DONet_ndiff` re-tests the idea with the verified adjacency.

### scratch_scripts/ (analysis; run from repo root, CPU is fine)
- `build_adjacency_canonical.py` — builds + verifies the data-order adjacency from `canonical.vtu`.
- `visualize_neighbour_diff.py` — GT Vm neighbour differences for one heart → `.vtu` (static
  summary + `.pvd` series: `ndiff`=mean|ΔVm|, `signed`=Vm−mean(neighbours)) + `gradient_signal.png`
  (Σ_edge (V_d−V_s)² vs t). `--heart` = global index 0..124.
- `compare_pred_neighbour_diff.py` — pred vs GT from a `test_predictions.npz`; overlays the
  gradient-signal curves, writes per-node `ndiff_err`/`signed_err` (candidate loss fields) +
  scalar Vm/ndiff/signed MSEs. `--heart` = GLOBAL index; predictions exist only for test hearts
  100..124. (`build_adjacency_data_order.py`, `inspect_mesh.py`, `check_node_order.py` are earlier
  exploration, superseded.)
- No inference needed for test hearts: `Geo_DONet/Predictions/.../Test/test_predictions.npz`
  already has nodewise `pred`+`true` (mV, canonical order) for the 25 test hearts (global 100..124).

## Code edits

**Geo_DONet/** — clean rewrite (2026-06-03; replaces the original opnn baseline)
- 4 files: `main.py` (CONFIGURATION block + CLI + `train()`/`infer()`), `opnn.py` (`GeoDONet`
  + `chunked_forward` + checkpoint loaders), `utils.py` (data + eval, numpy/torch only),
  `viz.py` (metric tables, traces, 3D scatter SVGs, colorbars, `.vtu`).
- **Modes**: `python main.py` (train), `--test-model` (test split + eval), `--infer` (predict
  any cases; `--eval` to score). All defaults live in the CONFIGURATION block at the top of
  `main.py`; every default has a CLI override (see `--help` / README.md). `DATA_BASE` is a
  hardcoded constant there (no longer an env var).
- **Checkpoints are weights-only** (`{"model_state_dict": ...}`). Architecture is inferred from
  the weight shapes; the normalizer is rebuilt from `--train-data` each run — so ONE load path
  handles both new GeoDONet and **legacy original-opnn** checkpoints (legacy `_branch_g`/`_trunk`
  keys + scalar bias remapped; **SIREN checkpoints NOT supported** — sine trunk).
- **Defaults**: data `geo_donet_data_f601.npz` + `--frame-step 5` → f121; `width 300 depth 4`,
  `5000 ep`, `lr 5e-4` (`--lr-scheduled` → 5e-4→5e-5 linear over epochs), `--patience 500` early
  stop, split 95/5/25. `--grad-checkpoint` bounds GPU memory for many frames (f301/f601).
- **Snapshots work on Vanda**: `--snapshot` uses `--reference-xyz` (default `canonical_xyz.npz`)
  for the 3D scatters; `--vtu-out --mesh canonical.vtu` writes ParaView series; `--n-viz` picks
  which cases to render (global index or `all`; default first 2). Outputs land in
  `Predictions/<ckpt stem>/<type>/<case>/`. No longer needs `DIMON_training_data_healthy.npz`.
- [train.pbs](Geo_DONet/train.pbs), [train_f301.pbs](Geo_DONet/train_f301.pbs) — Vanda PBS headers.

**Geo_DONet_overfit/** — single-case overfit capacity test (2026-06-03)
- **Purpose**: isolate capacity from generalization. Overfit the baseline GeoDONet on one case;
  the branch collapses to a constant vector, so it tests whether the **Tanh trunk** (a
  coordinate-MLP) can represent the sharp V_m upstroke. Outcome logic: fits it → capacity is
  there, the deployed failure is generalization; still smears at **f601** (1 ms, upshoot
  resolved) → spectral bias confirmed → next step is an activation change (SIREN/Fourier
  features), NOT more width/depth (capacity at w300 d4 is already ample for one field).
- [overfit.py](Geo_DONet_overfit/overfit.py) **imports the actual `opnn.py`/`utils.py` from
  `../Geo_DONet/`** (via `sys.path`) so it tests the same arch, never a copy. Full-batch GD on
  the one case; **TF32 on by default** (`--no-tf32` for a full-fp32 run if you need MSE below the
  ~1e-3 TF32 floor); 5000-ep cap + **early stop** (patience 500 on train MSE, min-delta 1e-4
  relative — so a slow spectral-bias asymptote trips the stop). `best.pt` keeps strictly-best
  weights; `last.pt` the final.
- **Five upshoot diagnostics** → `Predictions/case0_f{N}_w300_d4/`: `loss.png` (does train MSE
  → 0?), `frame_error.png` (per-frame Rel L2 — spike at the depolarization frames?),
  **`traces.png`** (GT vs pred V_m(t) for nodes spanning early→late activation — the steepness
  money plot), `at_scatter.png` (AT MAE), `upstroke.png` (max dV/dt GT vs pred), + `overfit_log.txt`.
  Judge on the trace/per-frame plots, NOT the scalar MSE — the upstroke is a tiny volume fraction
  so MSE dilutes it.
- **Three self-contained PBS** (no `-v`/`-l` overrides — submit as-is):
  [overfit_f121.pbs](Geo_DONet_overfit/overfit_f121.pbs) (`--frame-step 5`, 3 h, no checkpoint),
  [overfit_f301.pbs](Geo_DONet_overfit/overfit_f301.pbs) (`--frame-step 2 --grad-checkpoint`, 7 h),
  [overfit_f601.pbs](Geo_DONet_overfit/overfit_f601.pbs) (`--frame-step 1 --grad-checkpoint`, 12 h).
  f301/f601 need grad-checkpoint (too many frame activations for 48 GB); f121 fits without.
  TF32 cut f121 epoch time ~20 % (eta 250→200 min/10k ep on A40).
- **First submission (jobs 1157332/3/4) all died in ~2 s, `Exit_status=1`, 0-byte logs** — NOT a
  Python bug (the script runs fine on the interactive node). Cause: the three PBS files carried
  `set -e`, which aborts on `load_dimon_env.sh`'s first `conda deactivate` (rc=1, silently). Fixed
  2026-06-04 by removing `set -e` from all three (see Vanda PBS conventions). Verified the corrected
  flow reaches Python with all imports loading. **Ready to resubmit.**

**Geo_DONet_SIREN/** — clean rewrite (2026-06-04; mirrors Geo_DONet's 4-file structure)
- 4 files: `main.py` (CONFIGURATION + CLI + `train()`/`infer()`/`main()`), `opnn.py`
  (`GeoDONetSIREN` = Tanh branch + **SineLayer** SIREN trunk, `build_trunk_chunks`/`chunked_forward`,
  checkpoint loaders), and **self-contained copies** of Geo_DONet's `utils.py` (data + eval +
  the **ndiff** `build_laplacian_operator`/`signed_laplacian_loss`) and `viz.py` (unchanged).
  The pre-rewrite monolith (`main.py` 777 lines + old `opnn.py` + `plot_*.py`) is in
  `_old_monolithic/`.
- **Modes** identical to Geo_DONet: train (default) / `--test-model` / `--infer`, same flags
  (`--snapshot`/`--vtu-out`/`--color-bar`/`--save`/`--cases`/`--n-viz`/`--train-data`/`--frame-step`).
- **SIREN-specific over the baseline**: `--omega-0` (default 30; CONFIGURATION `OMEGA_0`),
  `--ndiff-weight λ` + `--adj-file` (default `mesh_adjacency_data_order.npz`), `--grad-checkpoint`
  **on by default** (`GRAD_CHECKPOINT=True` — SIREN trunk activations need it even at f121),
  `CHUNK_FRAMES=10` (vs Tanh's 25), flat LR default **1e-4** (SIREN trains below the Tanh LR).
- **Checkpoints store `{model_state_dict, config}`** — unlike the shape-only GeoDONet checkpoints,
  because `omega_0` is a forward-time multiplier, not a weight, so it can't be inferred from the
  state_dict. Loader: new ckpts use the saved `config`; **legacy original-opnn SIREN ckpts**
  (`_branch_g`/`_trunk.linear`/scalar `bias`, no config) are remapped, arch inferred from shapes,
  `omega_0` defaulted to **30** (what all original SIREN runs used); the unused legacy bias dropped.
- **Naming**: `geodonet_siren_w{w}_d{d}_w0_{ω}_{ep}ep[_lrsched][_ndiff{λ}][_f{frames}]`.
- **PBS** (Vanda, submit from the folder): `train.pbs` (plain f121, 5000 ep), `train_f301.pbs`
  (plain f301, 3000 ep — the stale NSCC header/path is **fixed**), `train_ndiff.pbs` (SIREN+ndiff
  f121, scheduled LR), `train_ndiff_f301.pbs` (SIREN+ndiff f301, 3000 ep). ndiff scripts pass
  `--lr 5e-4 --lr-scheduled` (reproduces the original 5e-4→5e-5) and take `qsub -v LAM=<λ>`.
- **Validated (CPU, 2026-06-04)**: all 4 files compile; `chunked_forward` grad-checkpoint path
  bit-identical to plain; `signed_laplacian_loss` differentiable; **all 3 existing trained SIREN
  checkpoints** (1142478/1147941/1148776) load via the legacy remap; new-format checkpoint
  round-trips with a non-default `omega_0`. NOT yet run on GPU — the first GPU job is also the
  first end-to-end test of the rewrite.

**Geo_DONet_ndiff/** (new variant — copy of Geo_DONet + a spatial loss; 2026-05-29)
- Total loss `= MSE + λ·mean((L·E)²)`, `E=pred−gt`, `L=I−D⁻¹A` (signed neighbour difference on
  the canonical-order mesh). `--ndiff-weight 0` == Geo_DONet baseline exactly.
- [utils.py](Geo_DONet_ndiff/utils.py) — adds `--ndiff-weight λ` and `--adj-file` (default
  `mesh_adjacency_data_order.npz`, env `DIMON_ADJ_FILE`).
- [main.py](Geo_DONet_ndiff/main.py) — `build_laplacian_operator` + `signed_laplacian_loss`; loss
  added to the **train loop only** (val/test stay MSE so best-val selection is comparable to
  baseline); per-epoch log prints `MSE:` and `nDiff:`; `save_directory` gets a `_ndiff{λ}` tag.
- [train.pbs](Geo_DONet_ndiff/train.pbs) — now **λ=1.0** (override `qsub -v LAM=3 train.pbs`),
  w300, 5000 ep. λ=0.1 was tried first and found too low (see Findings). Validated: compiles + CPU
  unit-test of the loss (constant→~0, random→finite & differentiable).

**Not yet ported** (still have NSCC paths in `main.py` and NSCC PBS headers): `Cobiveco/`, `Cobiveco_v2/`, `Cobiveco_with_fiber/`, `Cobiveco_with_scar/`, `DIMON_PINN/`, `Geo_DeepONet/`, `Geo_DONet_grad/`, `Geo_DONet_ECG_joint/`, `ECG_transfer/`, plus upstream `Laplace/`, `ReactionDiffusion/`, `LV/`. Also `main_cv.py` in every ported folder still hardcodes the NSCC `DATA_BASE`.

**Not yet ported:** every other variant directory (`Cobiveco/`, `Cobiveco_v2/`, `Cobiveco_with_fiber/`, `Cobiveco_with_scar/`, `DIMON_PINN/`, `Geo_DeepONet/`, `Geo_DONet_grad/`, `Geo_DONet_ECG_joint/`, `ECG_transfer/`, plus upstream `Laplace/`, `ReactionDiffusion/`, `LV/`) still has hardcoded NSCC paths in `main.py` and NSCC-style PBS headers.

## Vanda PBS conventions (learned this run)

- Header: `#PBS -l select=1:ngpus=1` plus `#PBS -l walltime=...`. No `ncpus`, no `mem`, no `-P`, no `-q`.
- Default GPU is A40 (sm_86, 48 GB) — NSCC's `train.pbs` was tuned for A100, so A100 hyperparams may OOM. If `width=300 --batch-size 24` fails, drop batch size first.
- Submitted jobs end up in the `batch_gpu` queue automatically.
- **Queue walltime limits** (`qstat -Qf`): `batch_gpu` max **168:00:00**, default 24:00:00 — so runs >24h must set `#PBS -l walltime=` explicitly. `interactive_gpu` max 12h. `gpu`/`gpu_amd` max 48h.
- **LR schedule caveat**: `--lr-schedule` is `LinearLR(total_iters=epochs)` — it decays over the *full* `epochs`. A wall-kill before `epochs` completes leaves the model at mid-LR (schedule truncated). Size walltime so the run finishes, or expect a suboptimal best-val. Best-val checkpoint IS saved mid-run, so a kill isn't catastrophic, just suboptimal.
- **NEVER put `set -e` in a PBS script that sources `~/load_dimon_env.sh`** (2026-06-04). The env script is written for *interactive* sourcing: its first action is `conda deactivate 2>/dev/null`, which returns **rc=1** when there's nothing to deactivate (conda IS defined on the compute nodes). Under `set -e` that aborts the job at that line, and the `2>/dev/null` swallows the only message → **exit 1 with a 0-byte `.o` log** (looks like the job vanished). Reproduce: `bash -c 'set -e; source ~/load_dimon_env.sh'` → exit 1, no output. This is exactly what killed the first overfit submissions (jobs 1157332/3/4, all `Exit_status=1` in ~2 s). Every *other* PBS in the repo sources the env without `set -e` and runs fine — match that. Fixed in the three `Geo_DONet_overfit/overfit_f*.pbs`.

## Timing reference (A40, width=300, batch=24)

| run | per-epoch | source |
|---|---|---|
| f121 SIREN + ndiff, 5000 ep | ~0.19 min | `siren_ndiff.o1147941` = 941 min |
| f301 SIREN plain, 3000 ep | ~0.46 min | `Geo_DONet_SIREN.o1142478` = 1378 min |
| f301 SIREN + ndiff (est.) | ~0.5-0.55 min | → 5000 ep ≈ 44-48 h, request 60 h |

## Smoke tests that passed (2026-05-29)

- GPU sanity (matmul + `torch.cuda.get_arch_list()` shows sm_86) on `GN-A40-074`.
- `main.py --width 100 --batch-size 8 --epochs 5 --trunk cobiveco` ran end-to-end on a single A40, ~25 s ETA per epoch, loss curve written to `Predictions/geo_donet_5ep_w100/loss_curve.png`.
- Geo_DONet_ndiff `main.py`/`utils.py` compile; CPU unit-test of `signed_laplacian_loss` passes (constant field → ~1e-15, random → finite & differentiable). GPU run still pending.

## Findings — ndiff loss (2026-05-29)

First `Geo_DONet_ndiff` run at **λ=0.1** (`gd_ndiff.o1147597`): the `nDiff` term sat **flat at
its random-init value ~0.0147 through epoch 2760** while train MSE fell ~37× (1.68 → 0.043).
Two reads, both acted on:
1. **λ too low** — `λ·nDiff ≈ 0.0015` was only ~3 % of MSE, so no real gradient pressure.
   → bumped `Geo_DONet_ndiff` to **λ=1.0** (`λ·nDiff ≈ MSE` would need λ≈3; sweep 1/3/10 via `-v LAM=`).
2. **Spectral bias (likely the real cause)** — nDiff pinned at the GT's *own* Laplacian energy
   means the smooth Tanh trunk emits ~zero spatial Laplacian: it fits the smooth part of Vm but
   never the sharp wavefront, so the Laplacian-of-error can't fall regardless of λ. → the ndiff
   loss was ported to the **SIREN trunk** (`Geo_DONet_SIREN/train_ndiff.pbs`, f121) to test whether
   a high-frequency-capable net drives nDiff down where Tanh could not. Compare the two `nDiff`
   curves (Tanh-ndiff vs SIREN-ndiff, both f121).

## Results — test-set eval (25 hearts, mean ± std)

| Run | trunk | data | λ | ep | V_m Rel L2 | V_m MAE (mV) | AT Rel L2 | AT MAE (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | Tanh | f121 | 0 | 5000 | (val MSE 0.0399) | — | — | — |
| siren+ndiff f121 (`1147941`) | SIREN | f121 | 1 | 5000 | 0.143 | 3.99 | — | — |
| siren+ndiff **f301** (`1148776`) | SIREN | f301 | 1 | 3000 | **0.1442 ± 0.0204** | **3.97 ± 0.88** | **0.0822 ± 0.0225** | **5.13 ± 1.10** |
| ndiff λ1 (`1149334`) | Tanh | f121 | 1 | 5000 | 0.1482 ± 0.0127 | 4.26 ± 0.74 | 0.0952 ± 0.0229 | 6.15 ± 1.17 |
| ndiff λ3 (`1149335`) | Tanh | f121 | 3 | 5000 | 0.1498 ± 0.0136 | 4.31 ± 0.98 | 0.0960 ± 0.0255 | 6.17 ± 1.39 |

**Finding (2026-06-01): Tanh + ndiff did NOT help, confirming spectral bias.** Evaluated the
two Tanh λ=1/λ=3 checkpoints (f121, 5000 ep). V_m Rel L2 **0.1482** (λ1) / **0.1498** (λ3) —
both *worse* than the SIREN+ndiff f121 run (0.143) and the higher λ marginally worse than the
lower, i.e. adding spatial-Laplacian pressure on a Tanh trunk does nothing or slightly hurts.
This matches the training logs where `nDiff` stayed pinned at its random-init/GT value ~0.0142
at λ=0.1, 1, AND 3 — the smooth Tanh trunk emits ~zero spatial Laplacian, so the loss is inert
regardless of weight. AT MAE ~6.15–6.17 ms (worse than SIREN-f301's 5.13 ms). **Net: neither a
high-freq trunk (SIREN), finer temporal sampling (f301), nor a spatial-Laplacian loss (ndiff)
meaningfully sharpened the wavefront — the bottleneck is the trunk's spatial representation.**

**Finding (2026-05-31): f301 did NOT help.** Going from f121 (5 ms) to f301 (2 ms) temporal
resolution left V_m Rel L2 essentially unchanged (0.1442 vs 0.143 — marginally *worse*, within
noise). The extra temporal samples over the upstroke did not sharpen the depolarizing wavefront
at the metric level. Consistent with the spectral-bias read below: the bottleneck is the trunk's
spatial representation of the sharp wavefront, not temporal sampling. AT metrics (~8 % Rel L2,
~5 ms MAE) are the first AT numbers recorded on Vanda but have no f121 counterpart yet to compare.

## Live jobs
- `1142468` — Geo_DONet `--trunk cobiveco` 5000 ep — **DONE** (633 min). Best val MSE **0.03994**; train→0.025 but val drifted to ~0.059 (overfits past best). Checkpoint `Geo_DONet/CheckPts/model_chkpts_geo_donet_5000ep_w300_lrsched.pt`; eval already wrote `Predictions/geo_donet_5000ep_w300_lrsched/Test/test_predictions.npz` (pred+true, 25 test hearts).
- `1142478` — Geo_DONet_SIREN f601→f301 ω₀=30, 3000 ep — **DONE** (1378 min, ~0.46 min/ep). Checkpoint `..._3000ep_w300_w0_30_f301.pt`.
- `1147597` — Geo_DONet_ndiff **λ=0.1** — ran; nDiff stayed flat at ~0.0147 (see Findings), effectively the baseline (ndiff inactive). Superseded by the λ=1.0 config.
- `1147941` — Geo_DONet_SIREN **+ndiff** (λ=1, lr-sched, f121) 5000 ep — **DONE** (941 min). Test Rel L2 **0.143** / MAE **3.99 mV**. Checkpoint `..._5000ep_w300_w0_30_lrsched_ndiff1_f121.pt`. f121 (5 ms) V_m traces still smear the sharp depolarizing wavefront → motivates the f301 run below.
- `1148776` — Geo_DONet_SIREN **+ndiff λ=1, f301** 3000 ep — **DONE**. Eval'd 2026-05-31: V_m Rel L2 **0.1442 ± 0.0204**, MAE 3.97 mV; AT Rel L2 0.0822, MAE 5.13 ms. **No improvement over f301-plain or f121-ndiff** — see Results table. Checkpoint `..._3000ep_w300_w0_30_lrsched_ndiff1_f301.pt`. Note: earlier mis-launches `1148787`/`1148788` (SIREN, ndiff OFF, wrong-dir qsub) were killed.
- **clean Geo_DONet** (2026-06-03, jobs `1152842` train / `1152853` f301) — the rewrite is
  trained + eval'd. `geodonet_w300_d4_5000ep_lrsched.pt` (Tanh, f121) `--test-model` (25 test):
  V_m Rel L2 **0.1518 ± 0.0251**, MAE 4.73 mV; AT Rel L2 0.0932, MAE 6.03 ms — i.e. it reproduces
  the old baseline architecture (≈ the ndiff numbers), confirming the clean port is faithful.
  Caveat: an f301-trained checkpoint eval'd on the **f121** default grid reads ~0.1624, but that
  is a normalization mismatch (vm_scale differs by frame sampling) — for a clean f301 eval pass
  `--data-path geo_donet_data_f601.npz --frame-step 2` so data + normalizer are both f301.
- **Geo_DONet_overfit** (2026-06-03) — single-case overfit capacity test, baseline w300 d4 Tanh,
  case 0, at f121/f301/f601. Harness built + validated (compiles, smoke ran on the A40 interactive
  node); f121 ~200 min/5000 ep with TF32. First `qsub` (jobs `1157332`/`1157333`/`1157334`,
  2026-06-03) **all failed in ~2 s with `Exit_status=1` and 0-byte logs** — the `set -e` +
  `conda deactivate` interaction, NOT the experiment (fixed 2026-06-04, see PBS conventions).
  **Still PENDING results** — resubmit `qsub overfit_f{121,301,601}.pbs`. f601 is the decisive
  read: if `traces.png` still smears the upstroke there, the Tanh trunk is the limit
  (→ SIREN/Fourier next), not capacity or sampling.
- `1149334` / `1149335` — Geo_DONet_ndiff **λ=1 / λ=3** (Tanh, f121) 5000 ep — **DONE** (651 min each). `nDiff` stayed pinned at ~0.0142 at both λ (never fell vs λ=0.1). Best val MSE 0.039871 (λ1) / 0.040139 (λ3) ≈ baseline 0.03994. Eval'd 2026-06-01 (`--test-model 1 --skip-snapshots`, job 1150915): V_m Rel L2 **0.1482 ± 0.0127** (λ1) / **0.1498 ± 0.0136** (λ3); AT MAE 6.15 / 6.17 ms — see Results table + 2026-06-01 finding. Checkpoints `..._ndiff1.pt`, `..._ndiff3.pt`; `test_predictions.npz` in `Predictions/..._ndiff{1,3}/Test/`.

## Open items

1. Run the ndiff experiments (smoke-test 5 ep, then `qsub`): **Geo_DONet_ndiff λ=1.0** (`train.pbs`) and **Geo_DONet_SIREN +ndiff λ=1.0** (`train_ndiff.pbs`, f121). Key comparison: does `nDiff` fall on SIREN where it stayed flat on Tanh? Success = best-val MSE beats 0.03994 and/or the neighbour-diff error shrinks (re-run `compare_pred_neighbour_diff.py` on each `--test-model 1` output). Sweep λ ∈ {1,3,10} via `qsub -v LAM=`.
2. `DIMON_training_data_healthy*.npz` still not on Vanda — needed only for the Cobiveco*/DIMON_PINN variants now. The clean Geo_DONet is Cobiveco-only and uses `canonical_xyz.npz` for snapshots, so it no longer needs it.
3. Port `main_cv.py`'s `DATA_BASE` in the ported folders if you want cross-validation runs.
4. **Run the single-case overfit capacity test** (`Geo_DONet_overfit/`): `qsub overfit_f{121,301,601}.pbs`. Decision rule: if f601 (upshoot temporally resolved) still smears the upstroke in `traces.png`/`frame_error.png`, the Tanh trunk lacks the representation → switch activation (SIREN/Fourier features), not width/depth. If it fits the upshoot, the deployed failure is generalization, not capacity — pivot to data/conditioning/loss. This directly tests the spectral-bias hypothesis the Findings section has been inferring indirectly.
5. Decide whether to keep this fork on Vanda or rebase onto NSCC once it's back — edits stay narrow (DATA_BASE env vars, CLI args, PBS rewrites, the new Geo_DONet_ndiff + Geo_DONet_overfit variants + scratch_scripts/), so reverse-porting is cheap. Note the new pip deps (meshio, h5py).
